## DNA Double Helix

The landmark paper by Watson and Crick {{#cite watson1953}} describing the structure of DNA was actually published in *Nature* journal itself, making this citation style particularly appropriate for this work.

Their discovery fundamentally changed our understanding of heredity and molecular biology.

## Nature Style in Action

In scientific writing, Nature style allows for dense citations without disrupting the text flow. For example, when discussing multiple foundational works {{#cite watson1953}} {{#cite shannon1948}} {{#cite turing1950}}, the superscript numbers remain unobtrusive.

## Citation Density

Scientific papers often cite many works in a single sentence. Nature style handles this elegantly: "The foundations of modern biology, information theory, and computing {{#cite watson1953}} {{#cite shannon1948}} {{#cite turing1950}} {{#cite knuth1984}} {{#cite lamport1986}} emerged during the mid-20th century."

Notice how the superscript numbers don't interrupt reading, yet clearly mark each cited work.

## Reference List Format

In Nature style, the reference list is extremely compact, using:
- **Author et al.** for papers with many authors
- **Journal abbreviations**
- **Minimal punctuation**
- **Volume and page numbers** in condensed format

This makes the reference section much shorter than in other citation styles.
