## The Structure of DNA

One of the most celebrated discoveries in biology came from Watson and Crick {{#cite watson1953}}, whose elegant model of DNA's double helix structure revolutionized our understanding of genetics.

Their paper, published in Nature, demonstrated how scientific communication can be both concise and transformative.

## Comparing Citation Styles

Chicago Author-Date style excels at showing:
- **Temporal relationships** between works
- **Author attribution** directly in the text
- **Multiple authors** clearly (e.g., Watson and Crick)

This makes it particularly suitable for fields where the historical context and development of ideas matter.

## Cross-Disciplinary Impact

The intersection of biology {{#cite watson1953}}, mathematics {{#cite shannon1948}}, and computing {{#cite turing1950}} has created new fields like bioinformatics and computational biology.
