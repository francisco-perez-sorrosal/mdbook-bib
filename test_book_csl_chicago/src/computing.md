# Computing History

## Theoretical Foundations

The mathematical foundations of computing were established through several key works in the mid-20th century.

Alan Turing's exploration of machine intelligence {{#cite turing1950}} posed questions that continue to drive artificial intelligence research today.

## Information Theory

Shannon's mathematical theory of communication {{#cite shannon1948}} provided the theoretical underpinning for the digital age, introducing concepts like entropy and channel capacity.

## Document Processing

The evolution of document preparation systems shows how technology has transformed scholarly communication. Knuth's TeX system {{#cite knuth1984}} solved the problem of mathematical typesetting, while Lamport's LaTeX {{#cite lamport1986}} made these capabilities accessible to a broader audience.

## Chicago Style Features

Notice how Chicago Author-Date style:
1. Shows the author and year in the text
2. Makes it easy to identify when works were published
3. Groups citations naturally by author

For example, we can see the progression from Turing {{#cite turing1950}} through Shannon {{#cite shannon1948}} to Knuth {{#cite knuth1984}}.
