# Introduction to IEEE Citation Style

This test book demonstrates the **IEEE citation style** using mdbook-bib's CSL backend powered by hayagriva.

## What is IEEE Style?

The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) citation style uses **numbered citations** in square brackets, like this: {{#cite watson1953}}.

## Key Features

IEEE style is characterized by:
- **Numbered citations** in the text (e.g., [1], [2])
- **Consecutive numbering** based on order of first appearance
- **Compact reference format** in the bibliography
- Commonly used in engineering and computer science publications

## Example Citations

Multiple citations can appear together {{#cite shannon1948}} {{#cite knuth1984}}.

You can also use the shorthand syntax: @@turing1950 and @@lamport1986.

The bibliography will appear at the end of this book with all cited references.
