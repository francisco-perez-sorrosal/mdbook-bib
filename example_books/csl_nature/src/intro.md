# Introduction to Nature Citation Style

This test book demonstrates the **Nature citation style** using mdbook-bib's CSL backend powered by hayagriva.

## What is Nature Style?

The Nature citation style uses **superscript numbered citations**, like this: {{#cite watson1953}}.

This is the style used by the prestigious *Nature* journal and related publications.

## Key Features

Nature style is characterized by:
- **Superscript numbers** in the text (e.g., text<sup>1</sup>)
- **Numbered sequentially** by order of appearance
- **Compact, dense format** in the reference list
- **Author et al.** notation for multiple authors
- Optimized for scientific publications with many references

## Example Citations

Multiple citations appear as consecutive superscripts {{#cite shannon1948}} {{#cite knuth1984}}.

The shorthand @@notation also works: @@turing1950 and @@lamport1986.

## Why Nature Style?

Nature style is designed for:
1. **Space efficiency** in printed journals
2. **Minimal text disruption** - superscripts don't interrupt reading flow
3. **High citation density** - common in scientific papers
4. **Clear numerical ordering** - easy to locate references
