# Citation Variants

This chapter demonstrates all citation variants and when to use them.

## Standard vs Suppress-Author

Sometimes you mention the author by name and only need the year:

> Klabnik and Nichols [-@Klabnik2018] explain that ownership is Rust's most unique feature.

Compare with the full citation:

> @Klabnik2018 explain that ownership is Rust's most unique feature.

## Practical Examples

### Writing a Literature Review

The Rust programming language was first introduced to address systems programming challenges.
@Matsakis2014 presented the core design principles at ACM SIGAda.
The language has since matured significantly, with @Klabnik2018 providing comprehensive documentation.

The safety of Rust's type system has been formally verified.
Jung et al. [-@Jung2017] developed RustBelt, the first mechanized safety proof.
This work builds on decades of programming language research [@Blandy2021].

### Comparing Sources

Several authors have written about Rust's ownership system:

| Source | Focus |

| @Klabnik2018 | Learning and practical usage |
| @Matsakis2014 | Language design principles |
| @Jung2017 | Formal verification |
| @Blandy2021 | Systems programming techniques |
